# SmartProcess_SmartContractGenerator

The first version generating smart contracts from YAWL, which is published as a conference paper in 2021.

Afterward, we allow to generate from BPMN to smart contracts, and publish a journal in 2024.


## Direct execution: 
Go to `SmartProcess_SmartContractGenerator/Graphical2SmartContact_SCG/bin/Debug`, download this folder. 

* Execute `Graphical2SmartContact_SCG.exe` for BPMN to Solidity;
* Execute `YAWL2Solidity_SCG.exe` for YAWL to Solidity.

_Note: It may only be executable in Windows 10._
